####Weather
Temperature and pressure effect the rate at which particulate matter deposits onto the passive PM monitor, while other events such as high winds and precipitation can also have major effects. Please record each day's temperature and pressure from the same source. We recommend using Weather Underground ([weatherunderground.com](https://weatherunderground.com)) to find the closest weather station to you.
