This scan pattern takes a series of images with no overlap across a 5mm circular area at the center of the 6.8mm deposition surface. The scan pattern assumes the use of a 20x zoom using a 60mm RMS objective on the OpenFlexure microscope LS65. Images taken with this objective are 282 x 212μm.

The total deposition area of the slide is 36317000μm<sup>2</sup>.  This procedure produces 127 images with an area of 7592500 or less, accounting for vingetting, or approximately 21% of the deposition area.

Each procedure step is described verbally and graphically.  All vertical traces are in increments of 1/2 turn, or 384μm (each tooth of the gear moves 32μm). Each ☐ box represents 1/2 turn and can be marked to indicate progress through the procedure.  All images to be taken are marked by the © copyright symbol, for ironic intent. Please release your images under open licenses or into the public domain.

After each vertical trace, a horizontal adjustment of 1/2 turn is taken. A ◁ is provided to mark horizontal adjustments. It points left to remind you [me] which way to go.  Arrows are also provided. You never can be too careful.
